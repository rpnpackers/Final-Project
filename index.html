      <h1>Walkability in the US</h1>
      <div class='my-5'>
      <h2>Our Data</h2>
      <p>
            For this project we used the EPA's Smart Location Database which contains data based on the 2019 US census for individual blocks throughout the United States.
            More specifically, walkability is calculated based on intersection density, the proximity to transit stops, employment mix, and household employment mix.
            This database also contains individual data on population, land area, income, and other such factors which can be used to calculate further statistics.
            <div class='my-5'>
            1. How do states rank with respect to Walkability, and how does this compare to their rankings in other categories?
            <div class='my-5'>
            2. How does walkability differ betwwen cities with different climates?
            <div class='my-5'>
            3. Is there a geographical correlation between population density and walkability?
            <div class='my-5'>
            4. Is there a geographical correlation between low income and walkability?

      <h2>Census Data Rankings by State</h2>
      <iframe src="dens_rank.html" width="100%" height = "300" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
      <p>
        This plot compares the population density of each state. States with large cities, such as New York and California, tend to have a higher population density.
      </p>
      <iframe src="linc_rank.html" width="100%" height = "300" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
      <p>
        This plot compares the low income percentage of each state. The states with a higher low income percentage tend to be states with lower population, such as South Dakota and Montana.
      </p>
      <iframe src="pop_rank.html" width="100%" height = "300" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
      <p>
        This plot compares the absolute population of each state. There is a loose correlation between absolute population and population density.
      </p>
      <iframe src="walk_rank.html" width="100%" height = "300" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
      <p>
        This plot compares the average walkability in each state. States with a higher walkability index tend to also have a higher population density and absolute population.
      </p>
      <div class='my-5'>
      <p>
          When we combine the insights from the four vizualizations above, we are able to gather context for the graphs below. This helps us to see how each state compares.

      <h2>Geographical Walkability Visualizations</h2>
      <p>
            The following tabs show how walkability varies throughout 5 different major US cities. This is juxtaposed with population density and low income percentages for 
            those same areas. This allows you to see the differences in correlations between these variables in different cities.

      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <p>
            In summary, we can use these visualizations to see both how sates rank with respect to walkability and other major statistics, and how different major cities approach
            walkability. In the real world, this could be used to better inform city development and resource allocation to pedestrian projects. 
            <div class='my-5'>
              1. Our rankings suggest that states with higher population densities, higher income, and larger total populations, generally have greater walkability ratings when considering
              the entire state.
            <div class='my-5'>
              2. In cities with warmer climates like Los Angeles, walkability is more evenly distributed among areas of varying income while in colder cities like Minneapolis or Chicago
              walkability is more tied to income. 
              <div class='my-5'>
              3. There is a strong correlation between population density and walkability as shown by our chloropleths. This makes sense because if more people live in one area, 
              then there will likely be more resource within a walkable distance. 
              <div class='my-5'>
              4. Our geographical data suggests that in cities, as low income percentage increases, walkability generally increases as well.
